# Headspring Bot (hsbot)

It's your good buddy hsbot, now in C# (robots don't care for coffee) and on Slack.

# Developing Locally

Copy the appSettings.json file in Application\Hsbot.Hosting.Web to Application\Hsbot.Hosting.Web\appSettings.Development.json.  
Update the file with the *devbot* API key and you're off to the races.
